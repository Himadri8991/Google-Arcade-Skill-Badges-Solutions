## Click ```BigQuery``` from navigation menu > Untitled query

#### Run the following Queries ONE BY ONE in BigQuery Editor
### Task 1. Total confirmed cases

* ```Note``` Change ```YYYY-MM-DD``` from *Task 1. Total confirmed cases*
  
```
SELECT sum(cumulative_confirmed) as total_cases_worldwide
FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
WHERE date='YYYY-MM-DD'
```
### Task 2. Worst affected areas

```
WITH deaths_by_states AS (
    SELECT subregion1_name as state, sum(cumulative_deceased) as death_count
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE country_name="United States of America" and date='YYYY-MM-DD' and subregion1_name is NOT NULL
    GROUP BY subregion1_name
)
SELECT count(*) as count_of_states
FROM deaths_by_states
WHERE death_count > COUNTS
```
### Task 3. Identify hotspots

```
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT subregion1_name as state, sum(cumulative_confirmed) as total_confirmed_cases
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE country_code="US" AND date='YYYY-MM-DD' AND subregion1_name is NOT NULL
    GROUP BY subregion1_name
    ORDER BY total_confirmed_cases DESC
)
WHERE total_confirmed_cases > CASES
```

### Task 4. Fatality ratio

```
SELECT sum(cumulative_confirmed) as total_confirmed_cases,
       sum(cumulative_deceased) as total_deaths,
       (sum(cumulative_deceased)/sum(cumulative_confirmed))*100 as case_fatality_ratio
FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
WHERE country_name="Italy" AND date BETWEEN 'YYYY-MM-DD' and 'YYYY-MM-DD'
```

### Task 5. Identifying specific day

```
SELECT date
FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
WHERE country_name="Italy" and cumulative_deceased>DEATH
ORDER BY date asc
LIMIT 1
```
### Task 6. Finding days with zero net new cases

```
WITH india_cases_by_date AS (
    SELECT date, SUM(cumulative_confirmed) AS cases
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE country_name ="India" AND date BETWEEN 'YYYY-MM-DD' AND 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    GROUP BY date
    ORDER BY date ASC
), india_previous_day_comparison AS (
    SELECT date, cases, LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS previous_day, cases - LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS net_new_cases
    FROM india_cases_by_date
)
SELECT count(*)
FROM india_previous_day_comparison
WHERE net_new_cases=0
```

### Task 7. Doubling rate

```
WITH us_cases_by_date AS (
    SELECT date, SUM(cumulative_confirmed) AS cases
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE country_name="United States of America" AND date BETWEEN '2020-03-22' AND '2020-04-20'
    GROUP BY date
    ORDER BY date ASC
), us_previous_day_comparison AS (
    SELECT date, cases, LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS previous_day,
           cases - LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS net_new_cases,
           (cases - LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date))*100/LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS percentage_increase
    FROM us_cases_by_date
)
SELECT Date, cases AS Confirmed_Cases_On_Day, previous_day AS Confirmed_Cases_Previous_Day, percentage_increase AS Percentage_Increase_In_Cases
FROM us_previous_day_comparison
WHERE percentage_increase > %%
```

### Task 8. Recovery rate

```
WITH cases_by_country AS (

  SELECT

    country_name AS country,

    sum(cumulative_confirmed) AS cases,

    sum(cumulative_recovered) AS recovered_cases

  FROM

    bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data

  WHERE

    date = '2020-05-10'

  GROUP BY

    country_name

 )

, recovered_rate AS

(SELECT

  country, cases, recovered_cases,

  (recovered_cases * 100)/cases AS recovery_rate

FROM cases_by_country

)
SELECT country, cases AS confirmed_cases, recovered_cases, recovery_rate

FROM recovered_rate

WHERE cases > 50000

ORDER BY recovery_rate desc

LIMIT NUM
```

### Task 9. CDGR - Cumulative daily growth rate

```
WITH france_cases AS (
    SELECT date, SUM(cumulative_confirmed) AS total_cases
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
    WHERE country_name="France" AND date IN ('2020-01-24', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    GROUP BY date
    ORDER BY date
), summary AS (
    SELECT total_cases AS first_day_cases, LEAD(total_cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS last_day_cases,
           DATE_DIFF(LEAD(date) OVER(ORDER BY date), date, day) AS days_diff
    FROM france_cases
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT first_day_cases, last_day_cases, days_diff,
       POWER((last_day_cases/first_day_cases),(1/days_diff))-1 AS cdgr
FROM summary
```

### Task 10. Create a Looker Studio report

* Go to [Looker Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/)

```
SELECT date, SUM(cumulative_confirmed) AS country_cases,
       SUM(cumulative_deceased) AS country_deaths
FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
WHERE date BETWEEN 'YYYY-MM-DD' AND 'YYYY-MMM-DD'
  AND country_name ="United States of America"
GROUP BY date
```
